## Technologies Used

## Description

_This page, assigned by [Epicodus](https://epicodus.com), demonstrates changing and moving in the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree structure for an HTML page. Here we move through the DOM and change it with JavaScript and jQuery._

[The
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/javascript-and-jquery/dom-manipulation-and-traversal)
from [the curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com) for this project was originally assigned for pair programming during class time on Tuesday January 11th 2022. We did not get to it. I went through it later on my own starting on Wednesday the 19th. Check out more of my work at:
